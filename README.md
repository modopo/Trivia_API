# Trivia API
Trivia api is a web application that allows people to hold trivia on a regular basis using a webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game.

The app allows one to: 

1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer. 
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages in the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

## Database Setup
With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:
```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

## Running the server
